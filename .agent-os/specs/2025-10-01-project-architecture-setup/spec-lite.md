# Spec Summary (Lite)

Build a fully playable MVP of Syria Trivia with complete MVVM architecture, Hilt DI, Jetpack Compose UI, and all core gameplay screens. Users can select modules (Culture/History), choose difficulty levels, answer questions from the existing JSON pool, and see their results in both Arabic and English with proper RTL support. The app will feature a Syrian-inspired Material 3 design and handle question randomization, score tracking, and bilingual string resources.
